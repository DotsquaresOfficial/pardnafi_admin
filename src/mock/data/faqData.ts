        question: 'What is Blockchain?',
        answer: 'Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures security and transparency, making it resistant to tampering or revision.'
    },
    {
        id: '2',
        question: 'How does blockchain work?',
        answer: 'Blockchain works by creating a chain of blocks, each containing a set of transactions. These blocks are linked together through cryptographic hashes, ensuring that once data is written to a block, it cannot be altered without breaking the chain.'
    },
    {
        id: '3',
        question: 'What is a cryptocurrency?',
        answer: 'Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central authority or government, with Bitcoin being the most well-known example.'
    },
    {
        id: '4',
        question: 'What is a smart contract?',
        answer: 'A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. These contracts automatically execute when certain conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.'
    },
    {
        id: '5',
        question: 'What is the difference between a public and private blockchain?',
        answer: 'A public blockchain is open to anyone to join, verify transactions, and participate in the network, while a private blockchain restricts access to specific participants and is often used by businesses for internal processes.'
    },
    {
        id: '6',
        question: 'What is a blockchain node?',
        answer: 'A blockchain node is a computer that participates in the blockchain network, storing a copy of the entire blockchain and validating transactions. Nodes help maintain the network’s decentralization and security.'
    },
    {
        id: '7',
        question: 'What is a blockchain consensus algorithm?',
        answer: 'A consensus algorithm is a protocol used to achieve agreement among network participants on the validity of transactions. Common consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).'
    },
    {
        id: '8',
        question: 'What is a token in blockchain?',
        answer: 'A token is a digital asset created on a blockchain. Tokens can represent various assets, such as ownership stakes, utility, or value, and can be used for transactions or as a store of value.'
    },
    {
        id: '9',
        question: 'What are blockchain forks?',
        answer: 'A blockchain fork occurs when there is a divergence in the blockchain’s protocol, leading to a split into two separate chains. Forks can be either soft forks (backward-compatible) or hard forks (incompatible with previous versions).'
    },
    {
        id: '10',
        question: 'What is a blockchain wallet?',
        answer: 'A blockchain wallet is a digital tool that allows users to store and manage their cryptocurrency. It can be a hot wallet (connected to the internet) or a cold wallet (offline for enhanced security).'
    },
    {
        id: '11',
        question: 'What is Ethereum?',
        answer: 'Ethereum is an open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to create and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It introduced the concept of smart contracts to the blockchain ecosystem.'
    },
    {
        id: '12',
        question: 'What is mining in blockchain?',
        answer: 'Mining is the process by which new cryptocurrency tokens are created and transactions are verified on the blockchain. It involves solving complex mathematical problems that require computational power, particularly in Proof of Work systems like Bitcoin.'
    },
    {
        id: '13',
        question: 'What are decentralized applications (dApps)?',
        answer: 'Decentralized applications (dApps) are applications that run on a blockchain network, rather than on centralized servers. They are typically open-source, transparent, and resistant to censorship.'
    },
    {
        id: '14',
        question: 'What is Proof of Stake (PoS)?',
        answer: 'Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus algorithm where validators (participants) lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral to propose and validate blocks. It is considered more energy-efficient than Proof of Work (PoW).'
    },
    {
        id: '15',
        question: 'What is the significance of decentralization in blockchain?',
        answer: 'Decentralization in blockchain refers to the distribution of control and decision-making across a network of participants. It enhances security, reduces the risk of single points of failure, and fosters transparency in transactions.'
